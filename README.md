# Intention Repeater Simple
A simple Intention Repeater created with help from WebGPT

This says in frequency display that it runs about 1000X slower than the regular Intention Repeater.
I think that the regular Intention Repeater may be misleading.

The regular Intention Repeater does not use Hashing.

This one may represent truer iterations and frequency count values.
