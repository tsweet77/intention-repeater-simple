# Intention Repeater Simple
A simple Intention Repeater created with help from WebGPT.

This says in frequency display that it runs about 1000X slower than
the regular Intention Repeater MAX (when not using Hashing).

I think that the regular Intention Repeater may be misleading.

The regular Intention Repeater MAX does not use Hashing.

This one may represent truer iterations and frequency count values.
